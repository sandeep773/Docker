Leverage Multi-stage builds
Multi-stage builds separate the build environment from the final runtime environment. They allow you to compile & package your application in one stage and then copy only the necessary artifacts to the final image, reducing its size significantly.
You'd typically combine these with a Light base Image as your final one (can you give me examples of such images?)
I made a small video on how to do this 🔗 youtu.be/hyLCBj1ko98


👉 Build Images from Scratch
If you only need to run a statically-compiled, standalone executable (like a C++ or Go application), pack it inside an empty Image by using “scratch” as the base image.

👉 Use fewer Layers
Each instruction like RUN or COPY adds another layer to your image, thus increasing its size. Each layer comes with its own metadata & file system structures. The fewer layers you use, the lesser data overhead your image has.

Have you found any other size reduction strategies that work for you?
